**PSumSim: A Simulator for Partial-Sum Quantization in Analog Matrix-Vector Multipliers**

This project includes a Python package useful for simulating partial-sum
quantization in matrix-vector multipliers (MVMs) using a histogram-based
data format.

## Information for Reviewers
In case of acceptance of the provided manuscript, this repository is made available
publicly under an open-source license. Currently, it is solely provided
for the purpose of reviewing the manuscript at-hand. See {std:ref}`infolicense`.

## How to Install
This provides a python package. Downloading all files and using
```bash
python3 -m pip install --editable .
```
in the same directory where this README is found installs the package and
allows all changes in source-files to reflect immediately.
Remove the `--editable` switch to install the package like any other Python
package, but you cannot change the provided *.py* files.

Also consider using a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install
packages into. This prevents any possible package-version clashes with things
you already have installed.

## How to Use
After installing, there are several things provided by PSumSim.

### Commandline
Use
```bash
psumsim --help
```
to get an overview over the commandline interface. This is made for running
the same experiments as for the paper to get the scatter-plot data.
E.g. use
```bash
psumsim -j 4 -b 0.1 -e 0.2
```
to run 10% of all experiments with 4 CPU jobs. Several of these calls can be
used to keep the simulation machine busy.

See {std:ref}`commandlineinterface` for full documentation or simply call
`psumsim --help`.

### As a Package
Check `psumsim.simulation.simulateMvm`, which basically is what is called for
each simulated experiment. Use this in your own Python script to get histograms
reflecting your own MVM application.

### Tests
To simply check that the installation worked, first install test dependencies by
running
```bash
python3 -m pip install --editable ".[test]"
```
and again possibly ommit `--editable` just like in
[Installation Guidelines](#how-to-install). Then, run `psumsim_test`.
Under the hood, *pytest* is used. Possible commandline arguments are descibed
[here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html). Common usage
is to run a specific test case and exit immediately if that one fails,
as run e.g. by `psumsim_test -x -k "test_optimumClippingCriterion"` for the
test {any}`test_optimumClippingCriterion`.

### Docs
To build the documentation website, first install dependencies using
```bash
python3 -m pip install --editable ".[docs]"
```
and again possibly ommit `--editable` just like in
[Installation Guidelines](#how-to-install). Then, run
```bash
sphinx-build -b html -W -E doc/source doc/build
```
in the main directory. After the command completes, you'll find the documentation
as a website *docs/build/index.html*.
