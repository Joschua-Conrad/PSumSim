Welcome to PSumSim's documentation!
===================================
This framework helps with understanding how partial sums are quantized
in matrix-vector multipliers (MVMs). You can setup a MVM application including
quantization and tiling/chunking and can trace value probabilities, fullscales,
best cliplimits and much more. Everything done in plain Numpy.
