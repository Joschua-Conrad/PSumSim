	"""Sum power of one axis into the histogram axis.
	
	Parameters
	----------
	tosum : `numpy.ndarray`
		Sum these value. Simulation modes *dostochastic* and *dostatisticdummy*
		(see `statstoc`) are supported.`
		
	reduceaxis : `int`
		One axis to reduce/sum into histogram axis. It is assumed that values
		along this axis are stochastically independent.
		
	histaxis : `int`
		Where the already existing histogram axis is found. Its values will
		be interpreted as described by `getHistValues`. The sum along this
		axis MUST yield *1.0*.
		
	positionweights : `numpy.ndarray`
		Weights to use along *reduceaxis* to weight summands. Must be a 1D
		array with same length as *histaxis* in *tosum*. Dtype must be `int`.
		While summing along `MAC_AXIS`, one probably uses only value *1* here.
		But when summing e.g. along ativation values, this is some
		`numpy.arange`.
	
	positionweightsonehot : `bool`
		If set, describes that along *reduceaxis*, the number of occurences
		of values happening in an actual computation is limited. For example,
		if first `MAC_AXIS` is reduced, the histogram describes for each
		activation value and for its possible occurence counts the
		probabilities. If there are 128 MAC operations, it is not possible
		that activation value 1 is set 128 times and value 2 also 128 times.
		So when reducing `ACT_AXIS`, set this parameter. The expected maximum
		value of the resulting histogram is then reduced to 128 activations
		having value 2, resulting in a maximum outcome
		:math:`128 \times 2 = 256`
		
		However, the computation :math:`128 \times 1 + 64 \times 2 = 256` is not
		outside the maximum range. The simulated probability of this impossible
		case is non-zero. This leads to one of the `limitations`.
		
		As a rule of thumb: set this for `ACT_AXIS` and `WEIGHT_AXIS` or if
		you look at the output-histogram length and think it is too long.
		
	disablereducecarry : `bool`
		If set, the occurences along *reduceaxis* are actually exclusive. This
		is a more extreme *positionweightsonehot*: not only the expected
		maximum value is limited, but along all histograms reduced, only one can
		have a non-zero value. So values along *reduceaxis* are not added to
		a running result one-by-one, but probabilities leading to one result
		bin can just be added up, because they are exclusive.
		
		To stay with the example above, after having `MAC_AXIS` reduced and while
		reducing `ACT_AXIS`, there still could be a totally valid summation
		:math:`64 \times 1 + 64 \times 2 = 192`. So along *reduceaxis*
		(which here holds value *1* and *2*) it is possible that activation *1*
		occured some times along MACs and value *2* also occured some times.
		They are not exclusive and *disablereducecarry* should not be set.
		
		BUt if you first reduce `ACT_AXIS` and `WEIGHT_AXIS` before reducing
		`MAC_AXIS`, you can set this. Because in reality,
		`ACT_AXIS` and `WEIGHT_AXIS` describe a one-hot 2D matrix, where in
		reality one digit will occur saying "this MAC multiplied this weight
		and this activation value". *disablereducecarry* should be set then.
		
		As a rule of thumb, set this when first reducing `ACT_AXIS` and
		`WEIGHT_AXIS` or when expecting that of all combined histograms,
		only one value in reality will be set.
	
	chunkoffsets : `numpy.ndarray`
		Must be as long as the *overchunkaxis* dimension.
		See `chunks`. In principle, all axes besides *histaxis* and *reduceaxis*
		are treated in parallel and are kept like `probabilisticAdder` would
		have been called independently along them. But along one axis, one
		can add a rising offset to *positionweights*. In the end, we iterate
		over chunks and their offsets and over *reduceaxis* and over old
		histogram values and if the bin is set, we add
		:math:`\text{histvalue} \times (\text{positionweight} + \text{chunkoffset})`.
		The *chunkoffsets* are thereby usefule when having an axis like
		`ACT_AXIS` and chunking it. If we originally had 5 levels with
		*positionweights* *[-2, -1, 0, +1, +2]* and we chunk that into two
		chunks, we by default would get two chunks of length 3 with
		*positionweights* *[-1, 0, +1]*. Reducing the chunks afterwards simply
		gives wrong results. But we can use chunkoffsets *[-1, +2]* to get
		a sum of *positionweights* and *chunkoffsets* resulting into
		*[-2, -1, 0]* for first chunk and *[+1, +2, +3]* for second chunk.
		Now, each element in each chunk gets a correct weight. The uppermost
		weight *+3* is unsued, because it sits in a *residual chunk*
		(see `chunks`).
		
		Just use some `numpy.zeros` here, except when having used chunking on
		an axis, which needs non-uniform *positionweights*.
	
	overchunkaxis : `int`
		The axis over which chunks are given. Add a length-1 dim if needed.
		
	dostatisticdummy : `bool`
		See `statstoc`. Note that this function cannot run *dostatistic*
		simulations, as it always works on histograms.
		
	allowoptim : `bool`
		If set, runtime of this function can be accelerated by drawing the
		results from a binomial distribution and by directly summing-up
		probabilities and not histograms if *disablereducecarry* is set.
		Thereby, no error is made. Unset this only for debugging. In that case,
		the result is always created by iterating over chunks, *reduceaxis*
		and over *histaxis*, which simply takes time.

	Raises
	------
	`IndexError`
		If *reduceaxis*, *histaxis* and *overchunkaxis* are not three different
		values.
		
	`TypeError`
		If *positionweights* or *chunkoffsets* are not of some `int` dtype.
		
	`ValueError`
		If *chunkoffsets* of *positionweights* have a bad shape.
		
	`RuntimeError`
		If the new *histlen* is chosen bad, because result bins get shifted
		out.

	Returns
	-------
	target : `numpy.ndarray`
		Result with same dtype as *tosum*. *histaxis* is longer here, but still
		a sum over it gives *1.0*. Length of *reduceaxis* is 1.

	"""Apply quantization, clipping and scaling.
	
	See `quantization` and `clipping`.
	
	The functionality is merged, because this first computes a vector noting
	which original bins make it where into the quantized/clipped/scaled
	histogram and then using that lookup only once.
	
	Most parameters are python scalars. It is not possible to set different
	quantization/clipping/scaling for all the given histograms. That is because
	they are supposed to be added in the end, without adding some unexpected
	weighting/scaling to summands.

	Parameters
	----------
	toprocess : `numpy.ndarray`
		The array to quantize, scale and clip.
		All simulation modes as described in `statstoc` are allowed.
	
	maxhistvalue : `numpy.ndarray`
		See `maxhistvalue`. This is proessed like *toprocess* to keep the two
		synchronous, but is also needed to validate *mergevalues*, to
		round *cliplimit* as described in `clipping` and to be able to
		interpret *cliplimitfixed* as relative to a fullscale, to give
		even residual chunks (see `chunks`) the same clip rule.
		
	mergevalues : `int`, `float`, `None`
		Parameterizes quantization.
		If positive, is used as described in `quantization` to merge bins by
		dividing and rounding. If negative, describes the *histlen* (so the
		maximum magnitude) of the quantized histogram. Values on range *(-1;1)*
		or larger than the old histogram length
		would leave us with less than *3* bins or would have no effect.
		They raise an exception.
		
	dostatistic : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
		
	dostatisticdummy : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
		
	cliplimitfixed : `float`, `int`, `None`
		A fixed cliplimit (see `clipping`). If the cliplimit is relative to
		the standard devation, this already should be the product of a
		*cliplimitstddev* and a standard deviation (see `getHistStddev`)
		divided by an old full-scale.
		Pass only values larger than *1*. Values below *1* have no effect
		and values equal or below *0* raise an exception.
		
	valuescale : `float`, `int`, `None`
		A scale to apply on values. Also invokes `round` to get an integer
		number of bins. Is not used in `simulateMvm` and solely provided for
		consistency. Usually, this is used to scale histograms up to more
		bins, which *cliplimit* cannot do. Can even do sign flips by passing
		negative values. Is not checked at all.
		
		.. note::
			If you reduce a bincount by using *cliplimitfixed*, unclipped bins
			remain as-is. If you do the same with a *valuescale*, you merge
			lower bins like you would do with quantization.
			
	histaxis : `int`
		Histogram axis. Often, `HIST_AXIS` is used.
		
	scaledtype : `type`
		Something `numpy.array` would understand as *dtype*. All the clipping
		and scaling can leave us with bin values being non-integer, at least
		until `round` is used. For these values, an intermediate floating-point
		dtype is needed. Just pass `str` "float" to get the best
		platform-dependent dtype.

	Raises
	------
	`ValueError`
		
		- If *mergevlaues* was passed, but *maxhistvalue* is `None`.
		
		- If *cliplimitfixed* AND *valuescale* require some scaling.
		
		- If *mergevalues* is outside its valid range.
		
		- If *cliplimitfixed* is zero or smaller.

	Returns
	-------
	target : `numpy.ndarray`
		Quantized, clipped and scaled histograms. The dtype is kept. The
		*histaxis* is shorter due to clipping/quantization or longer due to
		*valuescale*.
		
	maxhistvalue : `numpy.ndarray`, `None`
		Synchronous to *target* as described in `maxhistvalue`. Denotes
		the scaled, clipped and quantized new full-scale. If the input
		param was `None`, the result is `None` as well.
		
	cliplimitfixed : `float`, `None`
		*cliplimitfixed* undergoes some `round` to lead to an integer *bincount*
		(see `clipping`). This value is very similar to the input parameter,
		but this value would lead already to the rounded bincount. So this is
		the cliplimit which actually was applied.
		
	mergevaluesret : `float`, `None`
		Similar to *cliplimitfixed* return value. *mergevalues* also needs to
		lead to an integer bincount and this *mergevalues* already leads
		directly to an integer bincount. If you passed a negative
		*mergevalues*, this is the positive value leading to the same result.
		Note that quantization definition is for positive *mergevalues*
		(see `quantization`). If `clipping` replaced or reduced quantization,
		that is also reflected here.

	"""Sum a few axes into histogram and then quantize.
	
	This bundles multiple calls to `probabilisticAdder` and one call to
	`quantizeClipScaleValues`.
	
	`probabilisticAdder` does not support simulation mode *dostatistic*
	(see `statstoc`), but that mode is implemented in this function.
	
	A word on axes indices: even though axes are reduced step by step, the
	dimensions are squeezed and removed only at the very end.
	So an axis index refers to what array you give as an input and not to the
	shape of some intermediate result. Also, all indices refer to an array
	where *histaxis* already exists, even if this call creates it. 
	
	Parameters
	----------
	tosum : `numpy.ndarray`
		This array to be summed.
		All simulation modes as described in `statstoc` are allowed.
		
	reduceaxes : `int`, ((`tuple` or `list`) of `int`)
		The axes for which `probabilisticAdder` shall be called.
		
	histaxis : `int`
		Histogram axis. Often, `HIST_AXIS` is used. Must always be given,
		even in *dostatistic*, where it has length 1. See also *docreatehistaxis*.
		
	stataxis : `int`
		The statistic axis. Often, `STAT_AXIS` is used. Even in
		*dostochastic*, this is needed and should refer to a length-1 dimension.
		
	positionweights : ((`tuple` or `list`) of (`None` or `numpy.ndarray` or *"same"* or *"hist"*)), `None`
		One *positionweights* for each reduced axis. See `probabilisticAdder`.
		These determine the weight of elements summed along the *reduceaxes* 
		`None` is the same like passing `None` for all axes.
		
		For each axis:
			
			- `numpy.ndarray` is just forwarded to `probabilisticAdder` as-is
			  for one axis. 
			
			- *"same"* uses an all-one vector with correct length. Use e.g. along
			  `MAC_AXIS`.
			  
			- *"hist"* uses weights for a histogram axis. These are like
			  `numpy.arange`. More exact: `getHistValues` is asked.
			  Useful for `WEIGHT_AXIS` and `ACT_AXIS`.
			  
			- `None` is like *same*.
			
	dostatistic : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
		
	dostatisticdummy : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
			
	maxhistvalue : `numpy.ndarray`, `None`
		See `maxhistvalue`. This is updated just like *tosum*. Could be ommitted,
		but some features then might raise exceptions.
			
	chunksizes : `None`, ((`tuple` or `list`) of (`int` or `None`)), optional
		The length of one chunk to chunk each axis. `None` disables chunking
		and reduces a full axis. `None` can be given once for all axes or
		for single axes. The default uses no chunking.
		
	docreatehistaxis : `bool`, optional
		If set, *histaxis* is added before doing anything else. Needed in the
		very first call of this function in a MVM simulation.
		The default assumes the axis exists already.
		
	mergevalues : `float`, `int`, `None`, optional
		See `quantization`. Parameterizes quantization in
		`quantizeClipScaleValues` done once at the end.
		The default uses no quantization.
		
	cliplimitstddev : `float`, `int`, `None`, optional
		See `clipping`. This cliplimit is interpreted as multiple of standard
		deviations. `getHistStddev` is invoked automatically. The value is
		automatically clipped to a valid range, which does not leave you with
		less than *3* bins. But values being so large, that they show no
		effect are accpeted silently.
		The default uses no clipping.
		
	cliplimitfixed : `float`, `int`, `None`, optional
		See `clipping`. Instead of *cliplimitstddev*, one can pass a direct
		rule telling by which factor to reduce the bincount. Without any
		standard deviation. This is then directly passed to
		`quantizeClipScaleValues`. Use this to make two experiments comparable
		as described in `clipping`. In that case, use
		`applyCliplimitStddevAsFixedFrom`.
		The default uses no clipping.
		
	mergeeffortmodel : `None`, `callable`, *"digital"*, *"analog"*, optional
		If not `None`, this is used to compute some quantization-effort metric.
		A `callable` just gets a `numpy.ndarray` of `int` with the *stataxis*
		made *1* (because we want to know the cost per one computation).
		THe dtype is `int` and *histaxis* is also `None`. The passed value is
		the *bincount* (so the number of quantized levels) for each histogram.
		The callable should return a `float` python scalar rating the effort
		for running the ADCs to quantize these bins.
		
		*"analog"* uses a metric, where the effort raises linear with the number
		of levels, which refers to technology-limited ADCs. *"digital"* uses
		:math:`log_{2}` of the number of bins and sums these values over
		histograms.
		
		Note that residual chunks (see `chunks`) will possibly give a smaller
		number of levels and hence smaller effort.
		
		The default adds no merge-effort model.
		
	positionweightsonehot : ((`tuple` or `list`) of (`bool` or `None`)), `None`, optional
		One *positionweightsonehot* for each reduced axis. See `probabilisticAdder`.
		These determine computation of the full-scale.
		`None` is the same like passing `None` for all axes.
		
		For each axis:
			
			- `bool` is forwarded to `probabilisticAdder` as-is.
			
			- `None` equals `True` if *positionweights* is *"hist"* for this
			  axis and `False` otherwise. This is a useful default behavior,
			  which automatically makes reduction of `WEIGHT_AXIS` and
			  `ACT_AXIS` one-hot.
			  
		The default uses `None` on each axis.
			  
	chunkoffsetsteps : ((`tuple` or `list`) of (`int` or `None`)), `None`, optional
		Used to derive one *chunkoffsets* for each reduced axis.
		See `probabilisticAdder`.
		These are added on *positionweights* depending on where in the chunk
		we are during summation. Ignored, if *chunksize* is alrge enough to
		leave us with just a single chunk.
		`None` is the same like passing `None` for all axes.
		
		For each axis:
			
			- `None` results in using just zeros as *chunkoffsets*. The feature
			  is disabled.
			  
			- `int` is a stepwidth for constructing a `numpy.arange` of correct
			  length with this stepwidth. See `probabilisticAdder`. If you
			  chunked a histogram axis, pass the chunksize here when adding the
			  chunks later up.
			  
		The default uses `None` on each axis.
			  
	disablereducecarries : ((`tuple` or `list`) of (`bool` or `None`)), `None`, optional
		One *disablereducecarry* for each reduced axis. See `probabilisticAdder`.
		These determine stochastic dependecy of summands.
		`None` is the same like passing `None` for all axes.
		
		For each axis:
			
			- `bool` is forwarded to `probabilisticAdder` as-is.
			
			- `None` equals `False`. SO by default, this (rarely used) feature
			  is disabled.
			  
		The default uses `None` on each axis.
			  
	allowoptim : `bool`, optional
		Forwarded to `probabilisticAdder`. The default allows optimizations.
		
	selfcheckindummy : `bool`, optional
		If set and *dostatisticdummy* is set, a *dostatistic* (see `statstoc`)
		simulation is run in parallel to `probabilisticAdder`. It is then
		asserted, that both methods yield same results. That is nice for
		checking that `probabilisticAdder` is parameterized correctly.
		In other simulation modes, this switch has no effect.
		The default enables self-check.
		
		
	Raises
	------
	`IndexError`
		
		- If *stataxis*, *histaxis* or any *reduceaxes* are not distinct.
		
		- If *positionweights*, *positionweightsonehot*, *disablereducecarries*,
		  *chunkoffsetsteps* or *chunksizes* are not `None`, but have different
		  `len` compared to *reduceaxes*.
	
	`ValueError`
		
		- If *cliplimitstddev* and *cliplimitfixed* are enabled.
		
		- If a *chunksizes* element is smaller than *1*.
		
		- If a *positionweights* element is `numpy.ndarray` of bad shape.
		
		- If *maxhistvalue* is needed, but is `None`.
		
	`RuntimeError`
	
		- If broadcasted chunkoffsets and positionweights are not broadcastable
		  to *maxhistvalue*.
		  
		- If *dostatistic* found an out-of-bound result compared to
		  *maxhistvalue*.
		  
		- If *selfcheckindummy* failed.
		
	Returns
	-------
	target : `numpy.ndarray`
		Reduced array. Same dtype as *tosum*. *histaxis* was possibly added,
		or at least grew. *reduceaxes* vanished, except if they were chunked
		using *chunksize*. In that case, they are as long as the minimum
		chunk count required to not loose bins.
		
	mergeeffort : `float`, `None`
		If *mergeeffortmodel* was given, this is the mergeeffort.
		
	maxhistvalue : `numpy.ndarray`
		See `maxhistvalue`. If *maxhistvalue* was given as parameter, it was
		updated synchronous to *tosum* and now contains the full-scale of
		*target*.
		
	cliplimitfixed : `float`, `None`
		If *cliplimitfixed* or *cliplimitstddev* was set, `quantizeClipScaleValues`
		returned this as the actually applied limit, which would require no
		`round` to get integer bins. Can be used in consecutive calls of
		`reduceSum` and with `applyCliplimitStddevAsFixedFrom` to apply same
		cliplimits in different experiments. This then disables a possible
		statistic uncertainty in estimating standard deviations. See
		`clipping`.
	
	mergevalues : `float`, `None`
		Returned by `quantizeClipScaleValues` and notes the actual, always
		positive quantization rule applied. Includes reduced quantization if
		clipping already reduces bincounts.

	This adds padded bins to see where unquantized bins make it into quantized
	bins. Reverted quantization leads to paddded bins just between the discrete
	quantized levels. `quantizeClipScaleValues` is used for the up-scaling.
	Results field *mergevaluess* is used to track how much quantization was
	applied. Reverted clipping leads to bins padded at maximum and
	minimum using `packHist`. After reverting quantization, this is simply
	used to achieve the same bincount.
	
	See `quantization` and `clipping`.

	Parameters
	----------
	retunquantized : `dict`
		The result of an unquantized simulation from `simulateMvm`.
		All simulation modes as described in `statstoc` are allowed.
		Keys *results*, *maxhistvalue* and *mergevaluess* shall be present.
		*results* and *maxhistvlaue* are only needed at *runidx*, but
		*mergevaluess* is needed until *runidx*.
		
	retquantized : `dict`
		The quantized result. Should have a shorter *histaxis* than
		*retunquantized* and should have same simulation mode.
		
	runidx : `int`
		Results of this simulation iteration are equalized.
		
	histaxis : `int`
		Histogram axis. Often, `HIST_AXIS` is used.
		
	stataxis : `int`
		The statistic axis. Often, `STAT_AXIS` is used.  Even in
		*dostochastic*, this is needed and should refer to a length-1 dimension.
		
	dostatistic : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
		
	dostatisticdummy : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.

	Raises
	------
	`IndexError`
		If the *mergevaluess* accessed uring *runidx* do not have equal length,
		or if *stataxis* and *histaxis* are the same.
	`ValueError`
		If the unquantized run seems to have introduced a stronger quanization.
	`RuntimeError`
		If equalization failed, because the quantized histogram is longer than
		unqauntized one. Padding won't equalize the two then.

	Returns
	-------
	unquantizedresult : `numpy.ndarray`
		The *results* entry in *retunquantized* at *runidx*.
	processed : `numpy.ndarray`
		The equalized *results* entry in *retquantized* at *runidx*.

	"""Compute the SQNR of a quantized/clipped histogram in comparison to
	another one.
	
	In *dostatistic* and *dostatisticdummy*, that is easy, as for each separate
	computation the error can be determined. But in *dostochastic*, the
	error is not an error in y-axis of a histogram, but rather a distance in
	x-axis where a quantized bin was moved weighted by probability.
	So the stochastic computation starts at the center bin and tracks how much
	probability was given in excess and computes from that where an unquantized
	bin has been moved in quantized histogram. Negative and positiv histogram
	side are treated singly to keep histogram symmetry around 0.

	Parameters
	----------
	unquantized : `numpy.ndarray`
		The reference histogram with the clean signal without noise.
		All simulation modes as described in `statstoc` are allowed.
	quantized : `numpy.ndarray`
		The quantized histogram with quantization/clipping noise on top.
		Must have same simulation mode and length as *unquantized*.
		Use `equalizeQuantizedUnquantized` to achieve that.
		
	histaxis : `int`
		Histogram axis. Often, `HIST_AXIS` is used.
		
	stataxis : `int`
		The statistic axis. Often, `STAT_AXIS` is used.  Even in
		*dostochastic*, this is needed and should refer to a length-1 dimension.
		
	bincount : `int`
		Number of bins needed to determine bin values using `getHistValues`.
		
	dostatistic : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
		
	dostatisticdummy : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.

	errordtype : `type`
		Something `numpy.array` would understand as *dtype*. Even in
		*dostatistic* and *dostatisticdummy*, where we use `int` and `bool` in
		histograms, the error is some floating-point dtype. Which one is
		determined with this parameter. Just pass `str` "float" to get the best
		platform-dependent dtype.

	Raises
	------
	`ValueError`
		If *unquantized* and *quantized* do not have same shape.
	`IndexError`
		If *stataxis* and *histaxis* are the same.

	Returns
	-------
	snrlog : `float`
		The SQNR given in *dB*. Note that `numpy.inf` can occur here, if 
		*unquantized* and *quantized* are the same.
	errorprob : `numpy.ndarray`
		The error in bin probabilities when comparing *unquantized* and
		*quantized*. Even in *dostatistic* and *dostatisticdummy*, probabilities
		are given. So *stataxis* here always has length 1, a *histaxis* is
		*bincount* long and *errordtype* is used.
		
	errorpowerlinear : `numpy.ndarray`
		In shape and dtype like *errorprob*, but this is a histogram, where
		for each unquantized bin one can see which error power the bin
		contributes. Unquantized values occuring very often or being quantized
		to very different values contribute a large power.
	errorpowersquared : `numpy.ndarray`
		Like *errorpowerlinear*, but the error made when quantizing each bin is
		squared. Usefulf when computing with signal powers, e.g. for deriving
		*snrlog*.

	Parameters
	----------
	statisticdim : `int`, `None`
		If `None`, this is a *dostochastic* simulation. Otherwise, this
		specifies the number of parallel computations to do in order to gather
		statistic significance. See `statstoc`.
		
	dostatisticdummy : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
		
	activationlevels : `int`
		The number of levels the activations have. Kind of the activation
		bitwidth. See `quantization`. This is a *histlen*, not *bincount*.
		See `dataformat`.
		
	weightlevels : `int`
		Like *activationlevels*, but for weights.
		
	nummacs : `int`
		The number of multiplication results, which are to be summed into one
		single scalar by the MVM application. *statisticdim* of these
		applications run in parallel.
		
	randombehave : `scipy.stats.rv_continuous`, `str`
		The random characteristics of weights and activations. Pass a fully
		functional model (e.g. `scipy.stats.norm`) or a `str`:
			
		- *"uniform"* uses a uniform model giving all values same probability.
		
		- *"norm"* uses a normal distribution, where rare max/min values are
		  clipped into max/min bins.
		  
		- *"truncnorm"* also uses a normal distribution, but the outliers never
		  occur and never result in clipping.
		  
		- *"fullscale"* always draws the same and maximum positive value.
		 
	randomclips : (`list` or `tuple`) of `float`
		WHere to clip the *randombehave*. This is relevant for constructing
		*norm* and *clipnorm* and tells in terms of multiples of
		:math:`\sigma` where to place max/min bins.

	Raises

	`IndexError`

			*nummacs*. In *dostatistic* and *dostochastic*, the shape is the
			same, but *dostatistic* uses `int`, while *dostatisticdummy*
			uses `bool`. See also `dataformat`.
			
		activationsint
			Shape *[statisticdim, nummacs, 1]*. Dtype `int`. In *dostatistic*
			and *dostatisticdummy*, these are the actually drawn activations.
			In *dostochastic*, these are the mid-bin values and the mid-axis
			is *activationlevels\*2+1* long and not *nummacs*.

		weights
			Like *activations*.
			
		weightsint
			Like *activationsint*.

		activationhistidx
			Shape *[activationlevels\*2+1, weightlevels\*2+1]*. Denotes an `int`
			index to draw *activations* from when generating all combinations
			of activations and weights.

		weighthistidx
			Like *activationhistidx*.
			
		activationformult
			Elements from *activations*, but reshaped using the index rule 
			*activationhistidx*. This goes into multiplication.
		
		weightformult
			Like *activationformult*.

		multiplied
			Dtype like *activations*. But the shape is
			*[statisticdim, nummacs, activationlevels\*2+1, weightlevels\*2+1]*.
			For each statistic computation and each MAC operation, all combinations
			of possible activation and weight levels are present. In
			*dostatistic* and *dostatisticdummy*, the 
			*[activationlevels\*2+1, weightlevels\*2+1]* matrix is a one-hot one.
			The indices of the one-hot dot represent the used activation and
			weight value in that operation. In *dostochastic*, the sum
			over the *[activationlevels\*2+1, weightlevels\*2+1]* matrix is
			*1.0* and represents probabilities of all possible multiplication
			results. See `statstoc` and `dataformat`.

		firstmaxhistvalue
			Shape *[1, nummacs, 1]*. Dtype as *activations*. Can be used as
			*maxhistvalue* in first call of `reduceSum`. See `maxhistvalue`.

	Draw operands using `generateSimulationOperands` and then consecutively

	Parameters
	----------
	statisticdim : `int`, `None`
		Forwarded to `generateSimulationOperands`. See `statstoc`.
		
	dostatisticdummy : `bool`
		Simulation mode. See `statstoc`.
		
	selfcheckindummy : `bool`
		Forwarded to `reduceSum`, where it enables a self-check in
		*dostatisticdummy*. See `statstoc`.
		
	activationlevels : `int`
		Basically the activation bitwidth. Forwarded to
		`generateSimulationOperands`.
		
	weightlevels : `int`
		Basically the weight bitwidth. Forwarded to
		`generateSimulationOperands`.
		
	nummacs : `int`
		Number of multiplications which are summed into a single, scalar result
		in the MVM application. Forwarded to
		`generateSimulationOperands`.
		
	randombehave : `scipy.stats.rv_continuous`, `str`
		Random process to draw operands from. Forwarded to
		`generateSimulationOperands`.
		
	randomclips : `float`
		Max/min bin magnitude for default gaussian random behaviors.
		Forwarded to `generateSimulationOperands`.
	groups : (`list` or `tuple`) of `dict`
		Each entry describes a series of summations and possibly a
		quantization/clipping step. And each entry stands for a call to
		`reduceSum`. So each `dict` contains keyword arguments to
		`reduceSum`, not including:
			
		- *tosum*, because results of `reduceSum` are chained automatically.
		
		- *dostatistic*, because that is already given for all steps.
		
		- *dostatisticdummy*, because that is already given for all steps.
		
		- *selfcheckindummy*, because that is already given for all steps.
		
		- *stataxis*, because `STAT_AXIS` is used, which matches to
		  `generateSimulationOperands`.
		
		- *maxhistvalue*, because `generateSimulationOperands` gives a
		  good first value and following results from steps can be chained.
		
	Returns
	-------
	`dict`
		`str` keys and `numpy.ndarray` or (`list` of `numpy.ndarray`) values.
		
		All results from `generateSimulationOperands` are included. On top,
		there are more results, which are all (`list` of `numpy.ndarray`)
		values, because there is one result per `reduceSum` call. Key
		names are:
			
		results
			Reduced histogram. See `reduceSum`.
			
		mergeefforts
			ADC/Quantization cost. See `reduceSum`.
			
		maxhistvalues
			Maximum bin-value magnitude of result. See `reduceSum` and
			`maxhistvalue`.

		cliplimitfixeds
			Effectively applied cliplimit, after possibly needing to interpret
			it in multiple of standard devaitons. See `clipping` and
